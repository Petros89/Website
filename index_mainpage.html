I recently graduated from MSc program in M.Eng at the University of Pittsburgh and seeking for R&D opportunities in software
development for Big Data. My research interests are focused on the development of parallel programs & applications for High
Performance Computing (HPC). Modern applications like deep learning & AI demand higher computational power due to the vast
amounts of data and analytics, enabled by common and ubiquitous parallelism. Therefore, the development of computationally
efficient algorithms for computing and analyzing Big data becomes vital in many research and scientific areas like
Bioinformatics & Genomics Analysis, High Fidelity Forecast Predictions, Complex Multi-physics simulations and others. To this
end, i am excited to work on addressing basic questions like how applications can benefit from the new software development
trends? How AI and HPC parallelism empower processing large volumes of data leading to new patterns and types of applications?

<div style="height:6px;"></div>
Some of my current research projects and interests are listed below:

Researchers are sequencing both the novel coronavirus and the genomes of people afflicted with COVID-19 to understand, 
among other things, the spread of the disease and who is most affected. But analyzing genomic sequences takes time and
computing muscle.Based on the well-known Genome Analysis Toolkit, Parabricks uses GPUs to accelerate by as much as
50 times the analysis of sequence data.

Large-Eddy Simulation (LES) is a promising technique to model unsteady phenomenoa found in practical applications of turbulent flows. For example, in Internal Combustion Engines (ICE), LES can predict cycle-to-cycle variations in intake flow and combustion, a key for development of advanced engines. My research goal is to perform uncertainty quantified LES for practical applications.

Most combustion systems emit fine aerosol particles into the atmosphere. Measurement of number and mass distributions of fine particles is important to understand
their health effects, and to develop emissions regulations.
It is found that measured distribution is dependent on the design and
flow configuration of the measurement device (dilution sampler) itself. We have performed turbulent flow simulations of aerosol dynamics to understand the formation and evolution of particles inside the dilution samplers.

Motor vehicles are well known as sources of ambient air pollutants. Exposure to many of these pollutants has both acute
and chronic deleterious health effects. Most exposure to traffic-related pollution occurs in the near-roadway environment.
Thus better quantification of concentration of  pollutants near roadways is of great societal concern. Understanding the
turbulent transport and physico-chemical evolution of vehicle-related pollutants can prove beneficial for maintaining
sufficient levels of heathcare in construction and transportation activities.
