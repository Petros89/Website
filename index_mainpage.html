I am a second year PhD student in Computer Science at the University of Minnesota - Twin Cities (UMN). On April 2020 I graduated an MSc program
in Mechanical Engineering at the University of Pittsburgh with a focus in High Performance Computing for Numerical Computational Modeling of Engineering
applications like CFD and FEA. My research interests are focused on the software development for distributed memory parallelism (DMP) on clusters GPU clouds.
Modern applications like Deep Learning & AI demand higher computational power due to the vast amounts of data and analytics, enabled by common and ubiquitous
parallelism. Therefore, the development of computationally efficient algorithms for computing and analyzing Big Data becomes vital in many research and
scientific areas like Computational Bioinformatics for Petascale Genomics Analysis, Accurate Forecast Predictions, High-Fidelity Multi-Physics
Simulations like Additive Manufacturing and CFD, Autonomous Navigation Systems and others. To this end, i am very excited to address and provide solutions to
basic questions like how applications can benefit from the new software development trends? How AI and HPC parallelism empower processing large volumes of data
leading to new discoveries and types of applications? I hope that my research training during my PhD program at UMN will lead me on the right way to meet my
scientific and professional goals in the area of distributed computing for problems in the greater area of data science.

One of the greatest challenges in large-scale numerical analysis is the availability of computer memory for
solving the linear system of equations. Like in large-scale finite element simulations, where
the size of the system matrix assembly becomes very large, the FEA solver requires huge
amounts of computational time and memory that very often exceed the actual memory limits
of the available hardware resources. To overcome this problem, a GPU-enabled matrix-free 
conjugate gradient (MFCG) method is imlemented to finite element computations which
avoids the global matrix assembly. The main difference of the MFCG to the classical conjugate gradient (CG)
solver lies on the implementation of the matrix-vector product operation.
Matrix-vector operation found to be the most expensive process consuming more than 80%
out of the total computations for the numerical solution and thus a matrix-free matrix-vector
(MFMV) approach becomes beneficial for saving memory and computational time throughout the execution of the FEA.
A performance analysis on a TITAN V GPU between the parallel MFCG and NVIDIA Amgx matrix-assembly solver
shows that the MFCG solver is 2.12 × times faster consuming 7.76 × times less memory.
The parallel MFCG GPU solver achieves a maximum of 112 × speed-up allowing for the acceleration of the numerical solution
for mesh sizes up to 166.375M elements within a single 12GB RAM GPU using double-precision arithmetic.

<b>Real-Time Human Behavior Recognition Using Feature Engineering:<b>	
<tr>	
<tr>
<td style="width:50%" align="justify" valign="top">
This work proposes an efficient framework for human behavior recognition based on feature engineering from videos or web camera streaming.
It utilizes spatio-temporal information from 3D head pose estimation and local facial animation like eye-blinking to recognize human behavior in real-time.
The framework uses an open source library to track the facial feature points and the rigid body face transformations on each frame. Unlike activity recognition tasks,
where the algorithm can only globally recognize  a certain activity (i.e soccer, basketball, running, etc),  the proposed behavioral recognition framework buffers
local spatio-temporal vectors to detect and track subtle movements to perceive human behavior. Preliminary results show that the proposed framework holds promise
for automation in human behavior analysis aiming at fast and reliable mental state inference in movement disorders.

<b>Development and Application of Large-Eddy Simulation (LES) Models for Turbulent Flows:<b>	
<tr>
<td style="width:50%" align="justify" valign="top">
Large-Eddy Simulation (LES) is a promising technique to model unsteady phenomenoa found in practical applications of turbulent flows. For example, in Internal Combustion Engines (ICE), LES can predict cycle-to-cycle variations in intake flow and combustion, a key for development of advanced engines. My research goal is to perform uncertainty quantified LES for practical applications.

Most combustion systems emit fine aerosol particles into the atmosphere. Measurement of number and mass distributions of fine particles is important to understand
their health effects, and to develop emissions regulations.
It is found that measured distribution is dependent on the design and
flow configuration of the measurement device (dilution sampler) itself. We have performed turbulent flow simulations of aerosol dynamics to understand the formation and evolution of particles inside the dilution samplers.
