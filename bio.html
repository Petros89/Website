I was born on 01/10/1989 in Athens - Greece and obtained my Diploma in Mechanical Engineering
(5-year BSc & MSc joint degree; 300 ECTS) School of National Technical University of Athens - Greece (NTUA)
on November 2015. I came at Pittsburgh, PA - USA on 08/07/2018 to pursue my graduate (MSc) program in
Mechanical Engineering at Swanson School of Engineering - University of Pittburgh. My studies are mainly focused
on High Performance Computing (HPC) for Engineering Simulations aiming at optimal design for large-scale
computations - applications acceleration and high-fidelity predictions. During my graduate studies i have been training on
parallel progamming using distributed memory parallelism (MPI) on clusters and Graphics Processing Units (GPUs). During my
studies I worked as an Intern Software (R&D) Testing Engineer at ANSYS Inc in Canonsburgh from 05/13/2019 to 12/13/2019.
My main goals at ANSYS were dealing with computing the performance and testing of the HPC finite element solvers of ANSYS on
several Linux and Windows clusters and GPUs. I also worked on the development and product testing of an automated regression
tool for the parallelization of the execution of large QA lists containing thousands of programs on Linux clusters by
utilizing the Univa Grid Engine (UGE) scheduler on "lustre" shared-file system location. Last but not least, i enjoy playing
soccer and music (piano,drums,mpouzouki).
