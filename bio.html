I was born on 01/10/1989 in Athens - Greece and obtained my Diploma in Mechanical Engineering
(5-year BSc & MSc joint degree; 300 ECTS) School of National Technical University of Athens - Greece (NTUA)
on November 2015. I came at Pittsburgh, PA - USA on 08/07/2018 to pursue my graduate (MSc) program in
Mechanical Engineering at Swanson School of Engineering - University of Pittburgh with a focus on High Performance Computing (HPC).
Currently i am pursuing a PhD program in Computer Science at the University of Minnesota focused on the intersection of AI and HPC.
My research is based on distributed memory parallelism (MPI) and GPU computing aiming at best possible
acceleration and scalability of the most computationally demanding tasks involved in modern ditributed system applications. During my graduate studies
i worked for 8 months as a co-op Software (R&D) Testing Engineer at ANSYS in Canonsburgh on the HPC Finite Element solvers of ANSYS Mechanical APDL.
where i also worked on the development and product testing of an automated regression tool for the parallelization of the execution of large QA lists
containing thousands of programs on Linux clusters by utilizing the Univa Grid Engine (UGE) scheduler on "LUSTRE" parallel shared-file system. In my
free time, i enjoy running, playing soccer and music (piano,drums,mpouzouki), and reading books of Pythagoras, Plato, Aristotles, Helmholtz, Tesla, Kavafis and other
human beings whose work and living greatly influenced the reality that we all live today.
