I was born on 01/10/1989 in Athens - Greece and obtained my Diploma in Mechanical Engineering
School of National Technical University of Athens - Greece (NTUA) on November 2015. I obtained an MSc in Mechanical Engineering at Swanson School of Engineering
of the University of Pittburgh with a focus on High Performance Computing (HPC). Currently i am pursuing my PhD program in Computer Science at the University of
Minnesota focused on the intersection of AI and HPC. My research is based on distributed memory parallelism (MPI) and GPU computing aiming at best possible
acceleration and scalability of the most computationally demanding tasks involved in modern deep learning and distributed system applications. During my graduate
studies i have worked for 8 months as a co-op Software (R&D) Testing Engineer at ANSYS in Canonsburgh on computing the performance of the HPC finite element
solvers of ANSYS Mechanical APDL product. At ANSYS i also worked on the development of an automated regression tool for the parallelization of the execution of
large lists of thousands of processes on Linux clusters by utilizing the Univa Grid Engine (UGE) scheduler on a "LUSTRE" parallel shared-file system. In my
free time, i enjoy running, playing soccer and music (piano,drums,mpouzouki), and reading books of Pythagoras, Plato, Aristotles, Helmholtz, Tesla, Kavafis and other
human beings whose work and living have greatly shaped reality.
