I was born on 01/10/1989 in Athens - Greece and obtained my Diploma in Mechanical Engineering (5-year BSc & MSc joint degree; 300 ECTS) School of National Technical University of Athens - Greece (NTUA) on November 2015. I came at Pittsburgh, PA - USA on 08/07/2018 to start my graduate (MSc) program in Mechanical Engineering at Swanson School of Engineering - University of Pittburgh. My studies are concentrated on High Performance Computing (HPC) for Engineering Simulations aiming at optimized design, large scale computations - applications acceleration and high-fidelity predictions. Recently, i have been training myself on low-level programming for designing websites like this one using HTML and CSS languages. I have accepted a co-op position as a "software testing engineer" at ANSYS in Canonsburgh starting on 05/13/2019. My training at ANSYS will focus on developing and testing the High Performance Computing (HPC) Platforms of ANSYS. Last but not least, i enjoy playing soccer and music (piano,drums,mpouzouki).

Personal Concern: Why people (including myself) tend to differentiate themselves from the world instead of being unified...
